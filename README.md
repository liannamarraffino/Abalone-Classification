# Abalone-Classification

Abstract: 
Abalone are single shelled marine snails. This project applies several machine learning algorithms to classify the sex and age of abalone. The dataset from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository was used as it contains various features for abalone such as length, diameter, weight etc. Results show that it is difficult to differentiate between male and female abalone based on the features provided. The accuracy remained around 56% for this classification task with the best model being a linear discriminant analysis model. Classifying between adult and infant abalone showed more promising results with an accuracy of 84% achieved using a linear discriminant analysis model.
